## Overview

The dataset used in this project contains information on advertising spend across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels, along with corresponding sales figures. We analyze the data to understand relationships and correlations, visualize the data, and build a linear regression model to predict future sales.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You will also need to install the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `plotly`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly
```


## Summary

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict future sales based on advertising spend. Understanding these predictions can help businesses optimize their advertising budgets and forecast future sales more accurately.

Feel free to explore the code and make improvements or adaptations for your own use cases.
