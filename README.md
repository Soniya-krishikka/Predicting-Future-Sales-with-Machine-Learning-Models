# Predicting-Future-Sales-with-Machine-Learning-Models
The dataset used in this project contains information on advertising spend across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels, along with corresponding sales figures. We analyze the data to understand relationships and correlations, visualize the data, and build a linear regression model to predict future sales.
